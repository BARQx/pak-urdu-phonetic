[![Introduction to Pak Urdu Phonetic](assets/intro_ur.png)](assets/intro_ur.png)

> As someone who regularly works in Urdu — whether writing, researching, or just chatting — I’ve always relied on Pak Urdu Installer on Windows. Its phonetic layout made typing fast, intuitive, and effortless. For years, it just worked.
>
> But every time I tried to seriously use Linux (especially on my laptop), the lack of a polished, feature-rich Urdu layout always pulled me back. No layout matched the familiarity or usability of what we had on Windows.
>
> This project is my attempt to bridge that gap.
>
> It’s a faithful port of Pak Urdu Installer, a layout that feels like home for Urdu users across  platforms: Linux, Windows, and even the macOS.
>
> If you’ve ever wanted to type Urdu properly on Linux and couldn’t find “the one,” this might be it.

# Pak Urdu Phonetic

**Pak Urdu Phonetic** is an Urdu keyboard layout faithfully ported from the popular Windows-based [Pak Urdu Installer](https://mbilalm.com/urdu-installer.php) layout by **mBilalm**. It offers the same simple, intuitive phonetic typing experience and brings this widely adopted standard to the Keyman platform for cross-platform use.

**With over 160+ unique key mappings** across regular, Shift, AltGr (Right Alt), and Shift+AltGr combinations, this layout offers the most complete phonetic Urdu typing solution available — more comprehensive than any previous Urdu keyboard layout to date.

## What is this?

- Press `B` to get `ب`

It's designed specifically for Pakistani Urdu typing conventions and works exactly like the popular Windows-only Pak Urdu Installer.
